    <p>The easiest time recording application imagineable.</p>
<ul>
	<li>http://worked.rubyforge.org/</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="caps">DESCRIPTION</span>:</h2>
<p>Worked is really the simplest time recording (or tracking, whatever term you<br />
prefer) application that does all you need and nothing more (only `date &gt;&gt; file` is easier).</p>
<p>It simply takes a time or a time range and an activity and appends it to a<br />
hidden file in the current directory. The use case is, that you have &#8216;.worked&#8217;<br />
files in the root directories of your projects, and before you finish your<br />
current work period, you probably commit something and you also record your time.</p>
<p>Right now, the times are just recorded, no report generation yet.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">FEATURES</span>:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Appends a time range and an activity to a file.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="caps">SYNOPSIS</span>:</h2>
<p>The syntax is quite flexible, and if you&#8217;d like to have it extended, just drop<br />
me an email. The input consists of: &lt;time&gt; on &lt;activity&gt;. So for example, you<br />
can write &#8216;5 hours on documentation&#8217;. The following formats for the &lt;time&gt; part<br />
are recognized:</p>
<ul>
	<li>5 hours</li>
	<li>5h</li>
	<li>or simply &#8216;5&#8217;</li>
</ul>
<p>Minutes can be added or standing alone as well:</p>
<ul>
	<li>5 h 10 minutes</li>
	<li>5 hours 10 m</li>
	<li>30 minutes</li>
	<li>or simply &#8216;5:10&#8217;</li>
</ul>
<p>Stored is not the absolute time, but the point &lt;time&gt; hours ago and the current<br />
time.</p>
<p>Of course you can also specify both start- and end time of an activity with the<br />
following syntax:</p>
<ul>
	<li>13 to 17</li>
	<li>1 pm to 5 pm</li>
	<li>13:30 to 17:40</li>
</ul>
<p>If you just want to record an activity from a certain point upto now, you can<br />
write:</p>
<ul>
	<li>from 5pm</li>
	<li>from 11:30</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifying dates is not supported right now, but you can of course edit the file<br />
directly if necessary.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">STORY</span>:</h2>
<p>The week before my new semester started, I promised to myself to do better (or,<br />
to do it at all) time recording to get a better feeling for how much I actually<br />
worked. I used to write my time into a wiki, but that was still too tedious to<br />
do so I often neglected it and had to record it from memory some days later. So I<br />
needed a tool and a few hours later, &#8216;worked&#8217; was born.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">REQUIREMENTS</span>:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Uses the really great Treetop for the input parser.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="caps">INSTALL</span>:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>sudo gem install worked</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="caps">TODO</span>:</h2>
